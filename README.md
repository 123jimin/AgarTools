# AgarTools

Similarly to [this reverse-enginnering project](https://github.com/DnAp/Agar.io-Reverse-Engineering), this project focus on reverse-enginnering the scripts of [agar.io](agar.io) and replacing names with more friendly ones.

However, AgarTools is more focused on extensibility, you can fork this, remake `main_out.js` to keep up with recent updates, change variable names and add some other codes.
