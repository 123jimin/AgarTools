# AgarTools

Similarly to [this reverse-enginnering project](https://github.com/DnAp/Agar.io-Reverse-Engineering), this project focus on reverse-enginnering the scripts of [agar.io](agar.io) and replacing names with more friendly ones.

However, AgarTools is somewhat more focused on exposing internals and providing APIs for developing various plugins / AIs for agar.io.
